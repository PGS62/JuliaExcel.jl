"FunctionInfo","1.0",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"JuliaLaunch","Launches a local Julia session which ""listens"" to the current Excel session and responds to calls to JuliaEval etc..","","UseLinux","TRUE to run Julia as a Linux process under Windows Subsystem for Linux; FALSE (the default) to run as a Windows process.","MinimiseWindow","If TRUE, then the Julia session window is minimised; if FALSE (the default) then the window is sized normally.","CommandLineOptions","Command line options set when launching Julia.
Example : `--threads=auto --banner=no`.
https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/command-line-options/","Packages","Packages to load, which must be available in the default Julia environment (or environment set via the `--project` command line option). Delimit multiple packages with commas.","BashStatements","Relevant only when UseLinux is TRUE. Bash statements executed prior to launching Julia, which can be used to set environment variables. Example `export JULIA_PKG_DEVDIR=/mnt/c/Projects`. Delimit multiple statements with the line feed character.","TimeOut","The number of seconds to wait for Julia to launch before the function assumes that launch has failed (perhaps because of mal-formed CommandLineOptions). Optional and defaults to 30."
"JuliaInclude","Load a Julia source file into the Julia process, to make additional functions available via JuliaEval and JuliaCall.","","FileName","The full name of the file to be included.",,,,,,,,,,
"JuliaEval","Evaluate a Julia expression and return the result to an Excel worksheet.","","JuliaExpression","Any valid Julia code, as a string. Can also be a one-column range to evaluate multiple Julia statements.",,,,,,,,,,
"JuliaCall","Call a named Julia function, passing in data from the worksheet.","","JuliaFunction","The name of a Julia function that's defined in the Julia session, perhaps as a result of prior calls to JuliaInclude.","Args...","Zero or more arguments. Each argument may be a number, string, Boolean value, empty cell, an array of such values or an Excel range.",,,,,,,,
"JuliaSetVar","Set a global variable in the Julia process.","","VariableName","The name of the variable to be set. Must follow Julia's rules for allowed variable names.","RefersTo","An Excel range (from which the .Value2 property is read) or more generally a number, string, Boolean, Empty or array of such types. When called from VBA, nested arrays are supported.",,,,,,,,
"JuliaEvalVBA","Evaluate a Julia expression from VBA . Differs from JuliaCall in handling of 1-dimensional arrays, and strings longer than 32,767 characters. May return data of types that cannot be displayed on a worksheet, such as a dictionary or an array of arrays.",,"JuliaExpression","Any valid Julia code, as a string. Can also be a one-column range to evaluate multiple Julia statements.",,,,,,,,,,
"JuliaCallVBA","Call a named Julia function from VBA. Differs from JuliaCall in handling of 1-dimensional arrays, and strings longer than 32,767 characters. May return data of types that cannot be displayed on a worksheet, such as a dictionary or an array of arrays.",,"JuliaFunction","The name of a Julia function that's defined in the Julia session, perhaps as a result of prior calls to JuliaInclude.","Args...","Zero or more arguments. Each argument may be a number, string, Boolean value, empty cell, an array of such values or an Excel range.",,,,,,,,
"JuliaResultFile","Returns the name of the file to which the results of calls to JuliaCall, JuliaEval etc. are written. The file may be unserialised with function JuliaUnserialiseFile.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"JuliaUnserialiseFile","Unserialises the contents of the JuliaResultsFile.",,"FileName","The name (including path) of the file to be unserialised. Optional and defaults to the file name returned by JuliaResultFile.","ForWorksheet","Pass TRUE (the default) when calling from a worksheet, FALSE when calling from VBA. If FALSE, the function may return data structures that can exist in VBA but cannot be represented on a worksheet, such as a dictionary or an array of arrays.",,,,,,,,
"JuliaIsRunning","Returns TRUE if an instance of Julia is running and ""listening"" to the current Excel session, or FALSE otherwise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
