Can no longer specify the location of the JuliaExecutable (seemed not useful in practice, can always edit the PATH) and can specify packages to load. Turns out that packages should be ""used"" (via `using PackageName`) before the call to `using JuliaExcel`. That (seems to, fingers crossed) avoid ""world age"" problems that can be encountered when using Julia's eval function. We want to avoid defining the functions of JuliaEval (notably `encode_for_xl`) before we define the types it may operate on."
