# JuliaExcel

Call [Julia](https://julialang.org/) from Microsoft Excel worksheets and from VBA.  

Compatible with Excel's [dynamic array formulas](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dynamic-array-formulas-and-spilled-array-behavior-205c6b06-03ba-4151-89a1-87a7eb36e531).

Support Excel for Windows (not Mac). Julia can be run under Windows or Linux (via [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)).

## Installation
Installation does not require admin rights on the PC.
 * Both Julia and Microsoft Office must be installed on your PC, with Excel not running.
 * Ensure that the default terminal application is "Windows Console Host". See [issue 9](https://github.com/PGS62/JuliaExcel.jl/issues/9) for instructions.
 * Launch Julia, and copy-paste the following command into the REPL:  
   ```
   using Pkg
   Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/PGS62/JuliaExcel.jl",rev="v0.2.10")
   using JuliaExcel;JuliaExcel.installme()
   
   ```
   (paste into the REPL is via mouse right-click).
 * Click through a couple of dialogs.
 * Launch Excel. Check that the JuliaExcel functions are available by typing `=Julia` into a worksheet cell and checking that the auto-complete offers `JuliaCall`, `JuliaEval`, `JuliaInclude` etc.

The process is illustrated in the GIF below. F5 to replay.

## Installation (Linux)
As an alternative to calling Julia running in a Windows process, JuliaExcel can call Julia running in a Linux process under Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). If that's your preference, then in addition to the steps described above, you need to:
 * If necessary, install [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) with the default Linux distribution, Ubuntu.
 * Install Julia under WSL, as explained [here](https://ferrolho.github.io/blog/2019-01-26/how-to-install-julia-on-ubuntu). The last step in these instructions, to create a symbolic link to `julia` inside the `/usr/local/bin` folder is necessary.
 * At the Julia prompt (under WSL) install JuliaExcel by copy-pasting   
  `using Pkg; Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/PGS62/JuliaExcel.jl",rev="0.2.10")` into the REPL. 

## Functions
JuliaExcel makes the following functions available from Excel worksheets and from VBA:

## Example VBA
The VBA code below makes a call to `JuliaLaunch` and `JuliaEvalVBA` and then pastes the result to range A1:J10 in a new worksheet. To run it, make sure that the project has a reference to JuliaExcel (VBA editor, Tools menu -> References).

```vba
Sub DemoCallVBA()

    Dim ResultFromJulia As Variant, PasteHere As Range
    
    JuliaLaunch
    
    ResultFromJulia = JuliaEvalVBA("(1:10).^(1:10)'")

    Set PasteHere = Application.Workbooks.Add.Worksheets(1) _
        .Cells(1, 1).Resize(UBound(ResultFromJulia, 1), _
        UBound(ResultFromJulia, 2))
    
    PasteHere.Value = ResultFromJulia

End Sub
```

## Marshalling
Two question arose during implementation:

First, when data from a worksheet (or a VBA variable) is passed to `JuliaCall` or `JuliaSetVar`, that data is marshalled over to Julia. As what Julia type should the data arrive? Mostly, this is easy to decide, but what about one-dimensional arrays (from VBA) or ranges with just one column or one just row from an Excel worksheet? Should these have one-dimension or two over in Julia?

Second, after Julia has evaluated the expression, how should the result be marshalled in the opposite direction, back to Excel? Again, this is easy to decide for scalars and two dimensional arrays, but what about for vectors in Julia?

There were three objectives to the design of the marshalling processes:
 1) Round-tripping should work, i.e. the formula `=JuliaCall("identity",x)` should return an identical copy of `x`, whatever the "shape" of `x`.
 2) Matrix arithmetic should work naturally. In Julia, the `*` operator does matrix multiplication, so marshalling should be such that the formula `=JuliaCall("*",Range1,Range2)` performs the same matrix
 multiplication as the formula `=MMULT(Range1,Range2`), which calls Excel's built-in matrix multiplier.
 3) To allow use from `JuliaCall` of Julia's dot syntax for function broadcasting.
 
 The following marshalling scheme achieves the objectives:
 * Scalar values in Excel marshal back and forth to Julia as scalar values.
 * Two-dimensional arrays (or ranges) with more than one row and more than one column marshal back and forth as two-dimensional.
 * Single-column ranges, when passed to `JuliaCall` or `JuliaSetVar`, arrive in Julia as vectors.
 * Conversely, if the result of an evaluation in Julia is a vector, then the return from 
 `JuliaCall` or `JuliaEval` is a two dimensional array with one column, which occupies a single-column range on the worksheet.
 * Single-row ranges, when passed to `JuliaCall` or `JuliaSetVar`, arrive in Julia as 2-dimensional arrays with a single row.

For calls from VBA:
 * Vectors (one-dimensional arrays) in VBA are marshalled to vectors in Julia.
 * Vectors in Julia are marshalled by `JuliaCallVBA` and `JuliaEvalVBA` to vectors in VBA. The objective again is to achieve correct round-tripping, though this time VBA variable to and from Julia variable, as opposed to worksheet contents to and from Julia variable.

## Alternatives
There is one alternative method of calling Julia from Excel of which I am aware:  

https://github.com/JuliaComputing/JuliaInXL.jl  

JuliaComputing has recently (October 2021) made JuliaInXL open source, it having previously required a licence for commercial use. At the time of writing, JuliaInXL is not compatible with dynamic array formulas, and does not permit calling Julia from VBA. On the other hand, JuliaInXL uses socket-based communication and C# rather than VBA for serialisation and unserialisation on the Excel side. So in many scenarios, its performance will be better. I have yet to do extensive testing on that however.

## Compatibility
JuliaExcel has been tested on Excel under Microsoft 365, both 32-bit and 64-bit. It _should_ work on earlier versions of Excel (perhaps back to Excel 2010) but it has not been tested on them.

## How JuliaExcel works
The implementation of JuliaExcel is very "low-tech". When `JuliaEval` is called from a worksheet, the following happens:
1) VBA code (in JuliaExcel.xlam) writes the expression to a file in the `@JuliaExcel` sub-folder of the temporary folder.
2) VBA code then uses the Windows API `PostMessage` to send keystrokes `srv_xl()` to the Julia window.
3) That causes the Julia function `srv_xl` (defined in JuliaExcel.jl) to execute. The function reads the expression from file, evaluates it and writes to a result file.
4) The VBA code (in a wait loop since step 1) detects that the result file has been (completely) written, and unserialises its contents.

Other points to note:
 * `JuliaCall` is simply a wrapper to JuliaEval, with the arguments to `JuliaCall` being encoded using Julia's syntax for array literals.
 * The result file is written in a custom format designed to be fast to unserialise.
 * The "wait loop" includes a heart-beat check that Julia is still alive, so executing `=JuliaEval("exit()")` errors gracefully. 
 * There is obvious scope to improve this implementation by switching away from a file-based messaging system to one based on sockets.
 * But best performance would be achieved using C via the [Excel SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/excel/welcome-to-the-excel-software-development-kit) and [Julia Embedding](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/embedding/).

## Viewing the code
The VBA project is password protected to prevent accidental changes. You can see the VBA code [here](https://github.com/PGS62/JuliaExcel.jl/blob/master/vba/JuliaExcel.xlam/modMain.bas), or view it in JuliaExcel.xlam by unprotecting with the password "JuliaExcel". Julia source code is always visible on your PC, and the [@functionloc](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/InteractiveUtils/#InteractiveUtils.@functionloc) macro is an easy way to locate the code of any function you're interested in.

## Shortcomings
Given how JuliaExcel works, with file-based messaging and serialisation in VBA, an interpreted and hence relatively slow language, the most obvious shortcoming will be performance of the data-transfer Excel to Julia and back. That's not always a problem however, notably if the time for marshalling data between Excel and Julia is small (milliseconds) compared with the execution time of the Julia code (tens of seconds). I wrote JuliaExcel for a project where that situation holds.

Other shortcomings are:
 *  There is a limit on the length of expression that Julia is able to parse, which leads to errors when passing large arrays as arguments to `JuliaCall`. For example this formula to evaluate the sum of 700,000 random numbers: `JuliaEval("sum",RANDARRAY(700000))` produces the error `#(ErrorException("syntax: expression too large"))!`. 
 *  Given that the communication Julia to Excel is text-based with floating point numbers represented in base 10, there is the usual introduction round-off errors. For values near 1, such errors are of the order of 10 to the power -16.
 *  JuliaExcel does not work if Windows Terminal is the default terminal application. See [this issue](https://github.com/PGS62/JuliaExcel.jl/issues/9).
